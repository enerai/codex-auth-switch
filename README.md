# codex-auth-switch

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Tiny, auditable, offline Codex ChatGPT `auth.json` snapshot switcher for macOS, built for high-volume coding workflows with multiple authorized ChatGPT accounts.

`codex-auth-switch` is a minimal zsh CLI for developers who code a lot with Codex and want a clean way to switch between their own authorized ChatGPT accounts on one machine. It saves and restores local `auth.json` snapshots. It has no third-party runtime dependencies, does not install a dependency tree, does not call the network, and never prints credential contents.

This project is not affiliated with OpenAI.

## Why This Project Exists

Codex ChatGPT auth can be stored in:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/auth.json
```

If you have more than one authorized Codex account on the same Mac, switching accounts is really a local file operation: save the current `auth.json`, restore another one, then restart Codex so it rereads the file.

This tool makes that workflow explicit, repeatable, and easy to inspect.

## Who It Is For

This project is for developers, builders, and AI power users who:

- Use Codex heavily for programming, refactoring, debugging, and agentic coding.
- Keep multiple authorized ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus accounts for legitimate personal, work, region, team, or billing separation.
- Want fast account switching without browser gymnastics, dependency-heavy tools, background agents, or network services.
- Prefer a tiny local CLI whose behavior can be inspected in one file.

It is not for credential sharing, account pooling, or policy evasion.

## Highlights

- **Tiny CLI logic**: one zsh script, direct file operations, no daemon, no background service.
- **Zero third-party runtime dependencies**: no npm package tree, no pip environment, no bundled dependency chain.
- **Smaller supply-chain attack surface**: the first public release depends only on zsh and standard macOS tools such as `plutil` and BSD `stat`.
- **Offline by design**: no network requests, no OpenAI API calls, no telemetry.
- **Concrete safety properties**: strict file permissions, symlink refusal, bounded JSON output, token redaction, cloud-sync warnings.
- **Easy to audit**: the core behavior is in a single shell script, and the test suite uses temporary directories only.

## Security Claim

No CLI can honestly promise absolute safety against malware, a compromised local user account, or manual credential sharing.

What `codex-auth-switch` does promise is narrower and verifiable:

- It never sends network requests.
- It never calls `codex logout`.
- It never refreshes tokens.
- It never decodes JWTs.
- It never prints `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`, or full `auth.json` content.
- It refuses symlinked auth paths and state files.
- It writes state directories with mode `700`.
- It writes auth snapshots and state files with mode `600`.

Treat every `auth.json` and `*.auth.json` as a password.

## What It Does

- Saves the active Codex ChatGPT `auth.json` as a named local snapshot.
- Restores a saved snapshot into `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`.
- Supports a safe login flow for adding another account.
- Keeps snapshot and state file permissions strict.
- Provides a `doctor` command for local diagnostics.
- Provides `--json` output for automation and agent-friendly tooling.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not share, pool, sell, or broker accounts.
- It does not bypass usage limits, bans, rate limits, or policy enforcement.
- It does not automate account rotation.
- It does not call OpenAI APIs or any other network service.
- It does not parse, export, or print token values.

Only use this tool with accounts that you own or are explicitly authorized to use.

## Platform Support

First public release scope:

- macOS
- zsh
- Codex configured for file-backed ChatGPT auth

Linux support is not claimed yet.

## Install

From the repository root, install the script into your user bin directory:

```bash
./codex-auth-switch install
```

The default install path is:

```text
$HOME/.local/bin/codex-auth-switch
```

If `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, you can run:

```bash
codex-auth-switch version
```

You can also install to a custom location:

```bash
./codex-auth-switch install --bin-dir "$HOME/bin"
./codex-auth-switch install --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

`install` copies the current script. Re-run `install` after upgrading the repository checkout.

## Quick Start

Initialize Codex file-backed auth:

```bash
codex-auth-switch init --fix
codex-auth-switch --json doctor
```

Save the account that is currently logged in:

```bash
codex login
codex-auth-switch save personal
```

Add another account:

```bash
codex-auth-switch begin-login work
codex login
codex-auth-switch finish-login
```

Switch accounts:

```bash
codex-auth-switch use personal
# Restart Codex CLI or Codex App so it reads the restored auth.json.

codex-auth-switch use work
# Restart Codex CLI or Codex App again.
```

List saved snapshots:

```bash
codex-auth-switch list
codex-auth-switch current
```

Read the full guide in [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Paths

Default Codex auth path:

```text
CODEX_HOME=${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}
AUTH_FILE=$CODEX_HOME/auth.json
```

Default switcher state path:

```text
CODEX_AUTH_SWITCH_HOME=${CODEX_AUTH_SWITCH_HOME:-$HOME/.codex-auth-switch}
```

State layout:

```text
$CODEX_AUTH_SWITCH_HOME/
├── accounts/
├── meta/
├── before-login/
├── current
├── pending-login
└── lock/
```

Permission rules:

```text
directories: 700
auth.json / *.auth.json / meta / current / pending-login: 600
```

`CODEX_SWAP_HOME` is still accepted as a legacy state directory variable. If both variables are set, `CODEX_AUTH_SWITCH_HOME` wins.

## Commands

```text
codex-auth-switch [--json] init [--fix] [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] save <name> [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] use <name> [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] begin-login <name> [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] finish-login [name] [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] abort-login [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] install [--prefix <dir>|--bin-dir <dir>] [--force]
codex-auth-switch [--json] list
codex-auth-switch [--json] current
codex-auth-switch [--json] remove <name> [--active-too]
codex-auth-switch [--json] doctor
codex-auth-switch [--json] paths
codex-auth-switch [--json] version
```

Account names may contain ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores, and hyphens.

## JSON Output

All commands support `--json`. In JSON mode, stdout contains one envelope:

```json
{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "short summary"}],
  "structuredContent": {"result": {}},
  "isError": false
}
```

Business failures return a non-zero exit code:

```json
{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "short error"}],
  "structuredContent": {
    "error": {
      "code": "stable_error_code",
      "message": "what failed",
      "retryable": false,
      "field_errors": [],
      "suggested_fix": "what to do next"
    }
  },
  "isError": true
}
```

JSON output is intentionally bounded. `list` only shows account aliases, saved timestamps, current markers, and short hashes.

## Safety

- Do not commit auth snapshots.
- Do not share auth snapshots.
- Do not copy auth snapshots to another machine.
- Do not place switcher state in iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or another sync directory.
- Do not run multiple Codex sessions against the same account snapshot at the same time.
- Restart Codex CLI or Codex App after switching accounts.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md).

## Troubleshooting

Run:

```bash
codex-auth-switch --json doctor
```

`doctor` checks local paths, file-backed auth configuration, state permissions, symlink risk, invalid JSON, pending login state, installed copy drift, cloud sync path risk, and running Codex processes.

See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Tests

The test suite uses temporary directories and does not touch your real `~/.codex`:

```bash
zsh tests/test_codex_auth_switch.sh
```
